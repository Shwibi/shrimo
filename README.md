### Note

This is a solo project, I am the only one owning this project.
KeylAmi, the owner&admin of the Official TKOR server helped me with the ticketing system, so all the credit for the ticket goes to him, not me. 

### Privacy

The bot only logs the guild configuration into a MongoDB database, free of cost. It adds the information specified by the user as soon as the bot joins a server.
No user information except checking for users in a guild using their public user ID's are used by the bot.
